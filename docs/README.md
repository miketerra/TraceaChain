# Documentation README
TraceaChain Documentaion


## Conventions

* Source files are in RST format and found in the `docs/source` directory.
* The main entry point is index.rst, so to add something into the Table
  of Contents you would simply modify that file in the same manner as
  all of the other topics. It's very self-explanatory once you look at
  it.
* Relative links should be used whenever possible. The preferred
  syntax for this is: :doc:\`anchor text &lt;relativepath&gt;\`
  <br/>Do not put the .rst suffix at the end of the filepath.
* For non RST files, such as text files, MD or YAML files, link to the
  file on github.

Notes: The above means we have a dependency on the github mirror
repository. Relative links are unfortunately not working on github
when browsing through a RST file.
